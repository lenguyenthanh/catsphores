# catsphores

This is a project for me to learn about Synchronization and Concurrency via [Little book of Semaphores](https://www.greenteapress.com/semaphores/LittleBookOfSemaphores.pdf).

I'll use [Scala 3](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/scala3.html) and [Cats Effect 3](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/) as well as other functional programming techniques to solve problems from the book.


## Run

You can run a specific example by using bloop:

```Scala3
bloop run root -m se.thanh.catsphores.chapter1.MutualExclusive
```

/** A common usecase for Semaphores is to enforce mutual exclusion (Mutex)
  *
  * Often the code that needs to be protected is called the critical section, I suppose because it
  * is critically important to prevent concurrent access.
  *
  * Problem: multiple processes can access to a shared mutable value, use Semaphore to to enforce
  * mutual exclusion to that value.
  *
  * Solution: Create a semaphore named mutex that is initialized to 1. A value of one means that a
  * thread may proceed and access the shared variable; a value of zero means that it has to wait for
  * another thread to release the mutex.
  *
  * Cats Effect has native support for Mutex via
  * [Deferred](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/docs/std/deferred)
  *
